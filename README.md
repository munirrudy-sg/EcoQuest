## Description
EcoQuest: Adventure in Green Town is a 2D RPG for kids about sustainable living. The game begins with a distraught farmer whose crops have suffered from pollution. The farmer needs the player to save his crops and the environment. Players must complete two mini-games to help the farmer.

The first mini-game involves cleaning a park and sorting trash into recycling bins. This engaging activity aims to teach children about proper waste disposal and the importance of recycling into the correct bins. The second mini-game focuses on conserving resources by turning off light switches. This helps to remind children to always turn off the lights when not in use, encouraging them to develop the habit of conserving electricity.

Through these interactive mini-games, EcoQuest effectively conveys essential lessons about sustainable living to children in an enjoyable and relatable manner.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have the Java Development Kit installed on your machine. LibGDX games are Java-based, and you'll need the JDK for compiling and running Java applications.
- Gradle: While not strictly necessary due to the Gradle Wrapper, it's good to have Gradle installed. The Gradle Wrapper allows you to run Gradle tasks with the version of Gradle specified in your project without having to install Gradle yourself.

### Steps
1. **Clone or Initialize the LibGDX Project**: 
   - If you're starting a new project, use the LibGDX setup app to generate your project.
   - If you're working on an existing project, clone or download the project to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the root of your LibGDX project where the `gradlew` file is located (on Unix-like systems) or `gradlew.bat` (on Windows).

3. **Run the Game**:
   - For Unix-like systems, use `./gradlew desktop:run` (or the relevant module instead of 'desktop' if you're targeting another platform).
   - For Windows, use `gradlew.bat desktop:run`.

This command runs the `run` task from the desktop project or module, which is typically set up when you create a LibGDX project for desktop deployment.
